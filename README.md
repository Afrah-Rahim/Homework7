Chapter 7: Programming Problem 6 of 3rd edition (page 400), or Programming Problem 5 of 2nd edition (page 375):
This assignment asks you to test and implement algorithms given in the textbook using stacks to simulate a calculator,
as follows:
Consider simple infix expressions that consist of single-digit operands; the operators +, -, *, and /; and parentheses. 
Assume that unary operators are illegal and that the expression contains no embedded spaces. (Note: (3 + 4) is an infix 
expression, whereas (3 4 +) is its equivalent postfix expression.)
Design and implement a class of infix calculators. Use the algorithms given in this chapter to evaluate infix expressions, 
as entered into the calculator. You must first convert the infix expression to postfix form and then evaluate the resulting 
postfix expression. (You will have a method that takes a given String storing the infix expression and returns a String 
storing the equivalent postfix expression, and another method that takes a String storing a postfix expression and returns
what it evaluates to.)
